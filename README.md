# Predicting-House-Prices-with-Regression-using-TensorFlow
It's a guided project using tensorflow to predict the prices of house using feilds  : 
1. Year of sale of the house
2. The age of the house at the time of sale
3. Distance from city center
4. Number of stores in the locality
5. The latitude
6. The longitude 
Then for the model we used keras Sequential Model i.e. which is a linear stack of Layers.
then we visualize it for trained and untrained model it will follow the straight linear path for trained model so it shows that our predictions are accurate.
